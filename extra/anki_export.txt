What is short-run?	1 variable changes
What is long-run?	All variables adjust
What are runs about?	Runs are not about time!<div><br></div><div>They are about how many things adjust</div>
What is intermediate-run?	Some variables change, some don't
What happens to factor prices, technology, and factor supplies in the short-run?	<ul><li>Factor prices are exogenous</li><li>Technology and factor supplies are constant</li></ul>
What happens to factor prices, technology, and factor supplies in the long-run?	<ul><li>Factor prices fully adjust</li><li>Technology and factor supplies are changing</li></ul>
What happens to factor prices, technology, and factor supplies in the intermediate-run?	<ul><li>Factor prices fully adjust</li><li>Technology and factor supplies are constant</li></ul>
What does potential output mean?	Given technology, all factors are used optimally
Why is the AS curve upward sloping?	The quantity supplied increases when the price rises.<div><br></div><div>Cost per unit of factor is constant, but, cost per unit of output isn't constant</div>
What is a recessionary gap? What does it look like?	"<ul> <li>Equilibrium is to the left of potential output</li> <li>Factors are less than optimally employed</li> <li>Essentially, bunch of people walking around looking for jobs</li></ul><div><img src=""paste-d4f104936376f4d1e7a8314725beede4cf05b1a9.png""><br></div>"
What happens to the bargaining power of firms and unions in a recessionary gap?	<ul> <li>Bargaining power of firms increases</li> <li>Bargaining power of unions decreases</li></ul>
What happens to factor prices in a recessionary gap?	Factor prices become lower
What is an inflationary gap? What does it look like?	"<ul> <li>Equilibrium is to the right of potential output</li> <li>Factors are employed more optimally</li></ul><div><img src=""paste-d6952b7feae93d87e63820c9430118dc5a8ee161.png""><br></div>"
What happens to factor prices in an inflationary gap?	Factors prices increases
What happens in short-run?	<ul> <li>Short-run leads to change in factor prices</li> <li>Factor prices change AS curve</li> <li>Factor price change restores equilibrium back to potential output</li></ul>
What is easier? Factor pricing adjusting upward or downward? What is it called? Why?	<ul> <li>Factor prices adjusting upward is easier <ul> <li><i>Think:</i> how long would it take workers to agree to less wage?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Downward pressure can take a long time, while upward pressure can be instant</li></ul>
What is a shock?	Any event that causes the output to change significantly (an event that shifts either AD or AS)
What are positive shocks?	Shocks that move the output up
What are negative shocks?	Shocks that move the output down
What are some events that shift AD?	<ul> <li>Change in government spending</li> <li>Change in investment (business confidence, invention)</li> <li>Exports (foreign income)</li> <li>Wealth (stock market, homes)</li> <li>Taxes</li></ul>
What are things that shift the AD that the government controls?	<ul> <li>Government spending</li> <li>Taxes</li></ul>
What are some events that shift AS?	<ul> <li>Price of factors</li> <li>Change in technology</li> <li>Natural events</li></ul>
What is the Phillip's curve?	A relationship between GDP and the rate of change of money wages
What is decision lag?	The period of time between perceiving some problem and reaching a decision on what to do about it
What is execution lag?	The time that it takes to put policies in place after a decision has been made
What is recognition lag?	The time it takes to look at the economy and recognize that there is a recession
When is a recession recognized as an official recession?	When GDP goes down consecutively for 2 quarters
Is a temporary decrease in taxes effective as means of fiscal policy?	No
What does the presence of taxes and government do to the economy?	Makes it more stable
What influences the government's budget? What kind of events are these changes?	<ul> <li>Government spending and taxes</li> <li>They are fiscal events</li></ul>
When does Ricardian equivalence hold?	It holds if people don't react to change in taxes
What does fiscal stabilization policy do?	<ul> <li>Reduces the business cycles</li> <li>G and T are used</li></ul>
What is the difference between the economy adjusting itself and the government implementing fiscal policy to adjust the economy?	<ul> <li>Government adjusting can be faster (shorter recession)</li> <li>No inflation changes</li></ul>
What is the paradox of thrift?	<ul> <li>Self-fulfilling prophecy</li> <li>Short-run phenomenon</li></ul>
What are automatic stabilizers?	Elements of the tax-and-transfer system that reduce the responsiveness of real GDP to changes in autonomous expenditure
What is gross-tuning?	The use of fiscal policy to stabilize the economy such that large deviations from potential output do not persist for extended periods of time
What is fine-tuning? When is it not a good response?	<ul> <li>Fine-tuning is when fiscal policy tries to counteract every recession</li> <li>The attempt to maintain output at its potential level by means of frequent changes in fiscal or monetary policy</li> <li>Not a good response for the short-run</li></ul>
Why is gross-tuning more appropriate than fine-tuning?	<ul> <li>Gross-tuning is relatively cost-effective to fine-tuning</li> <li>Fine-tuning is more likely to deteriorate an economic stability</li></ul>
